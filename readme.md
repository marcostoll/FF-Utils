# What is the Fast Forward Family?
Fast Forward, in short **FF**, is a template for building web applications. The **FF Family** is a series of basic
repositories on which **FF** depends on but may also be used independently if desired.

**FF** is not a framework in and of itself and therefore should not be called so. But you may orchestrate multiple 
**FF** components to build an web application skeleton that provides the most common tasks.

# Introduction - What is FF\Utils?

The Utils component provides generic functionality used by many other **FF** components. You seldom want to require
this library by itself. In most cases you will get it by requiring one of the more complex **FF** components.

# Installation

# The Utils

The Utils classes each provide a bunch of static methods to deal with the namesake data or object type. The classes
only contain methods used by other **FF** components relying on the **Utils** component.

# Road map

The extend of the **Utils** component is solely defined by the needs of other **FF** components, so not concrete 
features are planned at this time. The component surely will grow as other **FF** components require additional logic 
that is not part of their domain.
